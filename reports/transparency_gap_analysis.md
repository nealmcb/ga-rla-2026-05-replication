# Transparency Gap Analysis — Georgia May 19, 2026 RLA
## Comparison to VotingWorks/Arlo PR #2350

---

## PR #2350 Overview

**Title:** "docs: Arlo comparison audit transparency report and guide"  
**Author:** nealmcb (Neal McBurnett)  
**Opened:** June 20, 2026  
**Repository:** `github.com/votingworks/arlo`  
**Related Issue:** #2351 — "Document and support best practices for running robust transparent reproducible audits"

The PR adds three planning documents to Arlo:
- `docs/transparency-report.md` — Current gap analysis across three audit phases
- `docs/transparency-implementation-plan.md` — Two-track implementation plan
- `docs/cloud-testing-deployment-plan.md` — Deployment/testing infrastructure

### Core Transparency Principles (from PR #2350)

1. **Software Independence**: The public must be able to detect election-system or audit-system errors without relying only on the same software stack that produced the audit outputs.

2. **Mechanical Verification**: Observers should be able to replicate the sample draw and risk calculation from published artifacts alone.

3. **Human Verification**: Physically present observers should be able to independently record audit-board interpretations and compare those against Arlo's record, without exposing the audit board to CVRs or expected votes.

4. **Blind Audit Principle**: Audit boards must interpret each ballot without seeing the CVR or expected machine interpretation. Observer tools must not contaminate the audit-board process.

5. **Public Posting Requirement**: Public posting of phase artifacts is required because observers do not have access to the Arlo instance. Arlo-internal availability is not public transparency.

6. **Phase-Based Artifacts**: Transparency is organized around three phases: pre-seed, post-seed/pre-comparison, and post-audit.

## Discrepancy Rate by Ballot Type (BMD vs. HMPB)

Georgia uses two ballot types with fundamentally different discrepancy sources:

- **BMD (Ballot Marking Device)**: In-person voting (Election Day, Advance Voting). The machine reads a QR code; audit boards read the human-readable printed text. Discrepancies arise when QR-code machine tallies differ from what auditors read on the printed text.
- **HMPB (Hand-Marked Paper Ballot)**: Absentee by Mail and Provisional. Hand-marked ovals read optically; audit boards read the same physical marks. Discrepancies tend to be fewer because both reads interpret the same marks.

Batch types were classified from the audit report batch name conventions:
- `ICC-Absentee by Mail` / `Absentee by Mail ICC` → Absentee-by-Mail (HMPB)
- `ICC-Provisional` / `Provisional` → Provisional (HMPB)
- `AV-...` / `Advance Voting` → Advance Voting (BMD)
- `ED-...` → Election Day (BMD)
- Combined/non-standard naming → Combined/Unknown

### Results (706 sampled batches)

| Batch Type | Batches | Ballots | Disc-Rep | Disc-Dem | % Batches with Disc | Σ Margin Δ Rep | Σ Margin Δ Dem |
|------------|---------|---------|----------|----------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Absentee-by-Mail **(HMPB)** | 214 | 5,679 | 7 | 9 | **6.5%** | 7 | 13 |
| Provisional **(HMPB)** | 38 | 161 | 1 | 1 | **5.3%** | 2 | 1 |
| Other ICC (HMPB) | 4 | 200 | 0 | 0 | **0.0%** | 0 | 0 |
| Election Day **(BMD)** | 269 | 108,070 | 22 | 24 | **13.8%** | 32 | 35 |
| Advance Voting **(BMD)** | 118 | 207,771 | 28 | 23 | **33.9%** | 47 | 48 |
| Combined/Unknown | 63 | 19,935 | 2 | 7 | **11.1%** | 3 | 9 |
| **TOTAL** | **706** | **341,816** | **60** | **64** | **14.2%** | **91** | **106** |

### Findings

1. **BMD batches have substantially higher discrepancy rates** than HMPB batches. Advance Voting BMD batches showed a 33.9% per-batch discrepancy rate vs. 6.5% for Absentee-by-Mail HMPB batches — a ~5× difference.

2. **This pattern is expected and non-alarming.** For BMD ballots, human auditors read printed text while machines read QR codes. Minor differences in how individual votes are printed vs. encoded, or how auditors interpret over/undervotes in the text, produce more frequent single-vote discrepancies. HMPB auditors and machines are both reading the same hand-marked ovals, so agreement is higher.

3. **Within BMD types, Advance Voting (33.9%) far exceeds Election Day (13.8%).** This may reflect larger AV batches (median ~1,760 ballots vs. ~401 for ED) — more ballots per batch means more chances for a one-vote discrepancy to appear. It could also reflect differences in auditor training, auditing location, or scanner calibration across the two voting periods.

4. **Discrepancy magnitudes are small.** The total margin change across all 706 sampled batches is 91 votes (Rep) and 106 votes (Dem) — out of 341,816 ballots hand-counted. No discrepancy was large enough to approach changing the outcome of either contest.

5. **No separate "HMPB/BMD" flag in the published artifacts.** The ballot type must be inferred from batch names. Georgia could improve transparency by explicitly tagging each batch with its ballot type in the manifest and audit report.

## Three Independent Check Results

### Check 1: Hash Commitment Check
**Can a public observer confirm that the later-posted batch tallies are exactly the files committed before hand-counting began?**

**Result: ✓ VERIFIED**

The @GaSecofState tweet thread (May 28, 2026, 11:52 AM EDT) committed SHA256 hashes of both artifact ZIPs before any county began hand-counting. Both hashes match the currently posted files exactly:
- `manifests.zip`: `c31d1f67404634ea04b4c68a5272655c9bd3879fe2233f4878819963cfc17aaf` ✓
- `candidate_totals.zip`: `2842be86bd615160f36f0af8f6d52a2fe1192103163dd51de8d8a1617ca10312` ✓

**Caveat — timing:** The tweet came ~3 minutes after the Arlo round was started (seed entered and sample drawn). The commitment is therefore post-seed rather than pre-seed. The SOS explicitly chose this to prevent giving hand-counters "a number to hit." The commitment proves the files were not altered during or after hand-counting, but cannot rule out alteration in the brief window between seed entry and the tweet.

**Caveat — durability:** The commitment lives only on X/Twitter and is not archived on sos.ga.gov or linked from the official SOS audit page. The tweet URL was not provided in the SOS press release.

**Correction to briefing:** The investigation briefing specified a prefix of `7d00771bf178007f4c6f43bf45b6`, which does not match either actual tweeted hash. That prefix appears to have been incorrect.

### Check 2: Sample Selection Check
**Can a public observer recompute the selected batches from the committed pre-seed artifacts and the dice-generated random seed?**

**Result: SUBSTANTIALLY YES (with caveats)**

- ✓ The seed is public (in the audit report)
- ✓ Individual batch ticket numbers are exactly reproducible using public `consistent_sampler` library
- ✓ Four ticket numbers verified
- ✗ The full PPEB draw order requires the exact numpy version used by Arlo at audit time
- ✗ No official sampler-inputs artifact was published

An independent observer can verify that individual batches were correctly assigned their ticket numbers. The complete sample order requires matching the numpy random state.

### Check 3: Risk Calculation Check
**Can a public observer recompute the final risk level from the selected sample and hand-count results?**

**Result: SUBSTANTIALLY YES (with effort)**

- ✓ Hand-count results are in the final audit report
- ✓ Reported results per batch are in the audit report
- ✓ MACRO source code is publicly available in the Arlo repo
- ✓ P-values (0.0491 Rep, 0.0417 Dem) are stated in the audit report
- ✗ Exact floating-point calculation requires Arlo's Python Decimal arithmetic
- ✗ The ballot count per batch (from manifests) must be correctly joined to candidate totals

## What Georgia Does Well

1. **Posts all three major artifact types**: final audit report (with hand counts), ballot manifests, and machine batch tallies — more than most jurisdictions provide
2. **Hash commitment verified**: Both `manifests.zip` and `candidate_totals.zip` hashes were committed in a public tweet thread before hand-counting began and match the currently posted files exactly
3. **Includes the random seed in the final audit report** — the seed (`06712221796172622814`) is publicly available
4. **Includes per-batch ticket numbers** — allowing partial independent verification (4/4 verified)
5. **Provides machine-readable CSV exports** — not scanned images or PDFs
6. **Public dice-roll event** — 20 participants, observed by media and the public
7. **Covers all 159 counties** — complete statewide scope
8. **5% risk limit** — among the lowest in the country for RLA jurisdictions
9. **First time two contests were audited** — expanded scope is commendable
10. **Explicit transparency rationale communicated**: The tweet thread explained why hashes were committed before files were published — demonstrating deliberate transparency design

---

## Transparency Gaps

1. **Hash commitment is post-seed, not pre-seed**: The tweet appeared ~3 minutes after the Arlo round started (seed entered, sample drawn). While it correctly commits the files before any hand-counting began, it does not prevent a scenario where someone with insider knowledge of the seed could alter batch tallies in the ~3 minute window. Committing before the dice roll would eliminate this residual risk.
2. **Commitment is hosted on X/Twitter only**: Not archived on sos.ga.gov; not linked from the official audit page; X imposes login/payment barriers for access
3. **No sampler inputs file**: There is no structured artifact listing all inputs to the PPEB sampler (contest totals, batch totals, risk limit, numpy seed) as a single machine-readable document
4. **No Arlo version specified**: Observers cannot know which Arlo code version to use for reproduction
5. **No per-jurisdiction transparency artifacts**: No official per-county list of selected batches; counties post their own notices inconsistently
6. **No ballot-type flag in published artifacts**: Batch names encode ballot type (BMD vs. HMPB) implicitly but no explicit field separates them. This makes batch-level discrepancy pattern analysis harder than it needs to be. Discrepancy rates differ substantially by type (BMD: 14–34%, HMPB: 5–7%), and explicitly tagging ballot type in the manifest would enable cleaner post-audit analysis.
7. **No pre-seed manifest commitment**: The manifests were not publicly committed before the dice roll event
8. **Social media dependency**: The critical hash commitment is posted only on X/Twitter — a commercial platform with paywalls and link rot
9. **No durable timestamp**: The tweet commitment lacks cryptographic timestamping or archiving
10. **Arlo instance not accessible to observers**: Observers cannot independently verify what Arlo shows; they must rely on the exported report

---

## Immediate Improvements (No Law Change Required)

Georgia could improve transparency significantly without legislative change:

1. **Post the full SHA256 hash as plain text on the official SOS audit page**, not just in a tweet
2. **Archive the commitment tweet** via Web Archive or similar before publishing the audit results
3. **Commit artifact hashes before the dice roll**, not after — generate the manifests and candidate totals export from Arlo, hash them, post the hash, then roll the dice
4. **Publish the Arlo version** (or git commit) used for each audit
5. **Publish a sampler-inputs file** listing all contest parameters, batch parameters, and the structured inputs to the PPEB calculation
6. **Standardize county-level result posting** — require each county to publish its selected batches and tally sheets in a uniform format
7. **Host all artifacts directly on sos.ga.gov** rather than MailChimp, for durability and auditability
8. **Link all artifact URLs from the permanent SOS audit information page** at `sos.ga.gov/page/elections-audit-information`

## Distinction: "Audit Was Conducted" vs. "Audit Is Independently Reproducible"

Georgia's 2026 primary RLA was conducted using legitimate procedures: public dice roll, Arlo software, all 159 counties, two contests, 5% risk limit, 706 batches hand-counted. The audit confirmed the election outcome. The process was observed by media and public attendees.

However, from the publicly posted artifacts alone, the audit is **not yet fully independently reproducible** in the sense described by PR #2350:

- The pre-seed hash commitment cannot be verified from current artifacts
- The hash commitment appears to have been posted after (not before) the seed was entered
- The full PPEB sample draw requires an unspecified numpy version
- No independent verification scripts were published
- County-level tally sheet posting is inconsistent

These gaps do not mean the audit was wrong. They mean the audit record does not yet provide the level of public transparency that would allow an independent party to replicate every step from first principles, using only the official public record.

---

## Relevance to Verified Voting's Public Statement

Georgia's expansion to two contests and continued use of Arlo with public artifact posting makes it a positive model for other jurisdictions. But a strong public statement should acknowledge that the transparency standard should be end-to-end public reproducibility, not merely the internal operation of audit software.

See `reports/README.md` for recommended language.
