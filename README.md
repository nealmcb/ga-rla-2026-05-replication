## What This Repository Contains

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `downloads/` | Official SOS-published artifacts (final audit report CSV, manifests ZIP, candidate totals ZIP, Jasper County PDF) |
| `extracted/` | Per-county CSVs from both ZIPs (159 counties × 2 artifact types) |
| `reports/` | Six analysis reports (hash verification, sample reproducibility, transparency gap analysis, etc.) |
| `scripts/` | Reproducible Python and shell scripts for hash checking, ticket verification, and artifact inspection |
| `hashes/` | SHA256 and SHA512 checksums of all downloaded files |
| `headers/` | HTTP response headers from all downloads |

## Key Results

- ✓ Both SHA256 hashes committed in the May 28 @GaSecofState tweet **verified** — files are byte-identical to what was committed before hand-counting began
- ✓ Full PPEB sample draw **independently reproduced**: 134/134 Senate Rep + 18/18 Governor Dem batches (100%) using numpy 1.26.4 and the established batch ordering
- ✓ Ticket numbers **independently reproduced** from the public seed using `consistent_sampler`
- ✓ Risk limit met: p = 4.91% (Senate Rep), p = 4.17% (Governor Dem)
- ⚠ BMD batches show ~5× higher discrepancy rates than HMPB batches (33.9% AV vs. 6.5% absentee) — see [BMD verifiability discussion](https://nealmcb.github.io/ga-rla-2026-05-replication/#bmd-verifiability-and-the-voter-verification-gap)
- ⚠ Only two contests audited — no RLA evidence exists for any other contest on the May 19 ballot
- ⚠ Hash commitment was ~3 minutes post-seed, not pre-seed

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nealmcb/ga-rla-2026-05-replication.git
cd ga-rla-2026-05-replication
pip install -r requirements.txt   # pins numpy==1.26.4 to match Arlo's lock file

# Verify the two committed hashes
sha256sum downloads/manifests.zip downloads/candidate_totals.zip

# Reproduce ticket numbers from the public seed
python3 scripts/reproduce_sample.py

# Reproduce the full PPEB sample draw (134/134 + 18/18 match)
python3 scripts/reproduce_ppeb_sample.py
```
