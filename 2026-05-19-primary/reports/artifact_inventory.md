## Hash Cross-Reference

The SOS June 3 press release states:
> "You can confirm that these were the same batch tallies that we started the audit with by performing a SHA256 hash of the file and matching it to the tweet from Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (@GASecofState) from 05/28/2026 at 11:52 AM."

**Both committed hashes verified.** The SHA256 hashes tweeted by @GaSecofState on May 28, 2026 match the currently posted files exactly:

| File | Tweeted hash | Match |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `manifests.zip` | `c31d1f67404634ea04b4c68a5272655c9bd3879fe2233f4878819963cfc17aaf` | ✓ |
| `candidate_totals.zip` | `2842be86bd615160f36f0af8f6d52a2fe1192103163dd51de8d8a1617ca10312` | ✓ |

Note: An earlier version of this investigation used an incorrect prefix (`7d00771bf178007f4c6f43bf45b6`) that does not correspond to either file. The actual tweeted hashes are the full 64-character values above.

See the [Hash Commitment Analysis](../hash_commitment/) for full details.
